	</header>

	<p class="mb-2">
		Rebus puzzles are a fun and creative type of brain teaser that use pictures, symbols, numbers,
		and letters to represent words or phrases. Solving them involves interpreting visual clues and
		thinking outside the box. These puzzles test your logic, language skills, and lateral thinking —
		all in a playful and rewarding way.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-2">
		Rebus puzzles stand out because they’re not just about what you see — they're about what you
		understand. The challenge lies in deciphering a hidden message using minimal visuals. That makes
		them perfect for puzzle lovers, wordplay enthusiasts, and anyone who enjoys a mental workout.
		Whether it’s guessing a famous phrase, idiom, or movie title, rebus puzzles offer a satisfying
		“aha!” moment when you finally crack the code.
